 (1) The table of messageRider is modified. I added attribute "coordinate" indicating the geolocation of curLocation for further computing.
 (2) The configuration conforms stipulations deployed on cPanel. Specifically, file .env and app.php in view as well as layout folder should be changed if run locally.
